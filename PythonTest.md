Sure! Testing is crucial to ensure the reliability and functionality of your code. Let's dive into different types of testing in Python, focusing on Unit Testing, Regression Testing, and Integration Testing, as well as other useful testing strategies.

### 1. **Unit Testing** 

Unit tests verify the smallest parts of your code, such as individual functions or methods. Python's built-in `unittest` module is commonly used for this purpose. Here’s how you can write unit tests:

#### **Steps to write a Unit Test:**

1. **Import the `unittest` module**.
2. **Define a test class** that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`.
3. **Write test methods** within the class (each test method should start with the word `test_`).
4. Use assertions (`assertEqual`, `assertTrue`, `assertFalse`, etc.) to check the output of your code.

#### **Example**:
```python
import unittest

# Code to be tested
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def subtract(a, b):
    return a - b

class TestMathOperations(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_add(self):
        self.assertEqual(add(3, 2), 5)  # Assert that 3 + 2 equals 5

    def test_subtract(self):
        self.assertEqual(subtract(5, 3), 2)  # Assert that 5 - 3 equals 2

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

### 2. **Regression Testing**

Regression testing ensures that new code changes do not break or negatively affect the existing codebase. While this isn't a type of test in itself, it involves running your unit tests after each change to make sure everything still works as expected.

#### **Steps:**
- You would use the same unit tests from above.
- Run all your tests after making any change to your code.

Example:
```bash
python -m unittest discover
```

This will run all the tests in your test files and give you feedback on whether anything broke.

### 3. **Integration Testing**

Integration tests check how different modules or services work together. This is important when you have multiple components that depend on each other.

#### **Example**:
Let’s say we have two functions: `add` and `multiply`. We also want to test them when combined.

```python
import unittest

# Code to be tested
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b

# Integration test
def calculate_total(a, b, c):
    result = add(a, b)
    return multiply(result, c)

class TestIntegration(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_calculate_total(self):
        self.assertEqual(calculate_total(2, 3, 4), 20)  # (2 + 3) * 4 = 20

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

### 4. **Functional Testing**

Functional tests verify that a function performs as expected under different conditions, without diving into the internal workings. It checks whether the function fulfills the expected result, similar to integration testing.

### 5. **Performance Testing**

Performance testing checks how well your code performs under certain conditions, such as handling large datasets or numerous concurrent requests. This is crucial for ensuring your code doesn't degrade over time.

For example, you might test how long a function takes to execute:
```python
import time

def performance_test():
    start_time = time.time()
    # Simulate long-running code
    sum(range(100000))
    end_time = time.time()
    print(f"Execution time: {end_time - start_time} seconds")

performance_test()
```

### 6. **Mocking (Unit Testing)**

Sometimes, you may need to mock external dependencies (e.g., databases, APIs) when writing unit tests to isolate the behavior of the code. You can use Python's `unittest.mock` module for this.

Example:
```python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import MagicMock

# Code that depends on an external service
def fetch_data_from_api():
    # Simulate fetching data
    return "Real Data"

def process_data():
    data = fetch_data_from_api()
    return f"Processed {data}"

class TestMocking(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_process_data_with_mock(self):
        mock_fetch = MagicMock(return_value="Mocked Data")
        # Replace the real function with the mocked one
        global fetch_data_from_api
        fetch_data_from_api = mock_fetch

        result = process_data()
        self.assertEqual(result, "Processed Mocked Data")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

### 7. **End-to-End Testing**

End-to-End (E2E) testing is used to test the full flow of an application, from the user's perspective. This can involve interactions with a front-end UI, making requests, and verifying responses.

For example, using `Selenium` for web application testing:
```bash
pip install selenium
```
Then, write a test that interacts with a website:
```python
from selenium import webdriver

def test_login():
    driver = webdriver.Chrome()
    driver.get("https://example.com/login")
    driver.find_element_by_id("username").send_keys("user")
    driver.find_element_by_id("password").send_keys("password")
    driver.find_element_by_id("login-button").click()
    assert "Welcome" in driver.page_source
    driver.quit()
```

### Summary

- **Unit Testing**: Tests individual functions or components.
- **Regression Testing**: Verifies that new changes don't break existing code.
- **Integration Testing**: Ensures that different components of the system work together.
- **Functional Testing**: Verifies that the system behaves according to the specifications.
- **Performance Testing**: Measures how well the system performs under stress or heavy load.
- **Mocking**: Used to simulate external systems when unit testing.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Tests the entire application from start to finish.
